- complete C header for GetFileHandle / ArchiveFile / UnarchiveFile
- reorder C header. Group functions, put PDTLIB_CMDLINE_SIZEOF and CMDLINE typedef together
- pdtlib@0008 (InstallTrampolines, C version). We write address at 2(a3,d0.w). Shouldn't offset be 0??
+ pdtlib::ParseCommandLine: optimize jsr(a1)/bra.s CheckCallbackReturnValue with a bra.s to the previous jsr
+ tail optimization for ArchiveFile: use exit procedure of UnarchiveFile
+ in case of early fail, CreateSymStr does not decrease sp by 20, contrary to a later fail
